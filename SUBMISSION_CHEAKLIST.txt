Venomous Snake Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network
This project focuses on detecting venomous snakes. In Bangladesh, snakebite envenoming is a serious public health issue. An estimated 1,200 people die annually, and 90% of fatal cases are caused by just three species. The main problem isn't the antivenom; it's the delayed or incorrect species identification by non-experts in rural areas. Time is venom, and rapid, accurate identification is life-saving.
